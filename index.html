          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>Yes I have. Well, I like to think so ... I have previous study experience from Western Sydney University though that is outdated. Covid has proven to be an opportune time to study once again!</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>More designer than programmer, though can understand what the code is doing anyways.</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>Given the circumstances with Covid, and the opportunity to study through OUA, I have been enabled to study through the now free time that I have and thus can continue with my degree./div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>I am hoping to become more fluent in coding and to learn new concepts and their applications</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>Usually Facebook, Gmail and Youtube, though I occassionally look through Reddit and do some light online shopping.</div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>I enjoy playing piano,cars and driving, photography and anything I.T. related!</div>
